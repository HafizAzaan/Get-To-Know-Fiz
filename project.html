        <p>This project, titled <strong>“Book Exchange System”</strong>, is designed to facilitate book exchanges between users. The primary users are students who are either willing to lend their books (Lenders) or looking for books to read for entertainment or educational purposes (Borrowers). This project was developed by a team of three during our degree semester. The content on this page focuses solely on the Borrower’s perspective.<br></p>

                    Return Book. Meanwhile, Lender has a fewer modules compared to Borrower. Lender has Register Book, Accept Borrow Book Request etc.

        </h3>
        <p>This project has been developed for my final year project. The aim of this project is to solve the problem of students struggling to find ride-hailing services from other students. Current solutions, like creating social media groups or posting announcements in random group chats, often fail because they get lost in too much information. This project proposes a new platform where students can easily find ride-hailing services offered by other students with just a few taps on their mobile devices. This platform will make it more convenient and ensure important information isn't missed. Here, only Passenger's and Admin's perspective will be provided.</p>

            for multiple drop-off locations, improving planning and budgeting. Traditional methods were slow and error-prone, risking client billing. This system, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the TollGuru API, offers an efficient,
